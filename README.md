Supplementary Code for [Dirac Traces and the Tutte Polynomial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08161).

 - Contains Mathematica code (diractraces.nb) for computing dimensionally regularized Dirac Traces with Tutte polonomial evaluations in Mathematica (Theorem 2.8). Comparisons to [TRACER](https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/ID/2987/), [FormTRACER](https://github.com/FormTracer/FormTracer), and [FeynCalc](https://feyncalc.github.io/) are also available. 
 - Also contains Mathematica code for computing 4-dimensional Dirac Traces by computing bicycle numbers of the associated graph (Theorem 2.10).
